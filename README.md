### R&P MCF project

Project so far:

* data✅
* literature✅
* code✅


What has yet to be done:

* make sense of results (tomorrow's discussion)
* IRFs: 
    1. bootstrapping to create confidence bands
    2. normalise vertical axis units to percentages
    3. prettify with GG plots
* add additional variable (credit risk, other?)
